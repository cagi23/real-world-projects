Project Idea 3: "Code for a Cause"
Use Case: A platform that connects developers with non-profit organizations in need of technical support. Developers can
use their skills to contribute to open source projects that have a social impact.

Skills Used: Angular, Java, J2EE, and potentially AI for matching developers with projects.

Tools Used: GitLab for version control and collaboration, and potentially an AI algorithm for matching developers with
projects based on their skills and interests.

Team Suggestion: Find a team member with experience in AI to help with the algorithm for matching developers with
projects.

Getting Started: Start by reaching out to non-profit organizations and finding out what kind of technical support they
need. Look into ways to efficiently match developers with projects based on their skills and interests.
