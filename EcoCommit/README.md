Project Idea 2: "EcoCommit"
Use Case: An app that rewards users for committing to environmentally friendly habits, such as using sustainable
transportation, reducing energy consumption, or supporting eco-friendly products.

Skills Used: Angular, Java, J2EE, and potentially AI for tracking and analyzing user data.

Tools Used: GitLab for version control and collaboration, and potentially Google Maps API for tracking location and
carbon footprint.

Team Suggestion: Find a team member with experience in data analysis and AI to help with tracking and analyzing user
data.

Getting Started: Start by researching the most impactful environmentally friendly habits and how they can be tracked.
Look into API integrations and brainstorm ways to incentivize users to commit to these habits.
