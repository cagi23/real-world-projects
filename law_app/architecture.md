to the application. Role-based access control (RBAC) can be used to define permissions for different user roles (e.g.,
lawyer, client).
Data Encryption: Data encryption techniques should be applied to sensitive information stored in the database and
transmitted over the network to protect against unauthorized access.
Infrastructure Layer:

Hosting: The application can be hosted on cloud infrastructure (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud) to ensure scalability,
reliability, and availability.
Load Balancing and Scaling: Load balancers can be used to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers, and
auto-scaling mechanisms can be employed to dynamically adjust resources based on demand.
Monitoring and Logging: Implement monitoring and logging solutions to track application performance, detect errors, and
troubleshoot issues in real-time.
This architecture provides a scalable and robust foundation for developing the sophisticated idea app for lawyers,
ensuring seamless collaboration and efficient management of legal tasks and documents.
